            <p class="problem">The problem</p>
            <p class="pproblem">With our tasks at work piling up and calendars notifying us of items past due it can be extremely stressful. Often, in times of high stress, self care activities like, taking a lunch break or spending time on a hobby, are the first places we sacrifice time on. When we’re busy and overwhelmed, taking the extra time to give back to ourselves can feel indulgent and timely.</p>
            <p class="project1Ptopspace pproblem"><b>How can we increase our awareness of practicing healthy self care habits and implement small, positive self care activities in a modern and consistent way?</b></p>
            <p class="solution">The solution</p>
            <p class="psolution">Sproutful is a self care activity tracker that helps you set aside time for you. Quickly set your own customized goals and reminders and check back regularly.</p>
            <p class="project1Ptopspace psolution">What differentiates Sproutful from others in its industry is the self care garden. As you add and complete more self care activities, the more seeds for your garden you earn - a relaxing incentive to check in on yourself. The more seeds you earn, the more plants you can plant in your self care garden. Take care of yourself, take care of your garden simultaneously, then get back to your best self.</p>

            <p class="whysurvey">From nearly 40 responses users ranged in age from 16 to 51 years old, participants helped me understand what could be improved upon the ways they currently track their self care as well as the pain points that are associated with their current methods.</p>
            <ul class="surveyresults" style="list-style-type:none;">
                <li><b>92%</b> of participants had recently or were currently practicing self care</li>
                <li class="surveyresultsspace"><b>74%</b> of users did not currently have a way to remind themselves to practice self care</li>
                <li><b>82%</b> of users did not have a way to track their self care</li>
                <li><b>72%</b> of users felt that digitally tracking their self care habits in an app would be beneficial to ensuring it was a priority</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="project1Ptopspace surveytakeaway">The underlying challenges included the lack of active reminders to keep self care a priority, the informality of ways users were keeping track of their activity (mentally noting when they had practiced self care or when it felt overdue) and customizability limitations in other apps.</p>

How can an app primarily dedicated to providing users greater accessibility to tracking and completing self care activities be balanced out with a positive reinforcement and incentive to return and continue to consistently positively impact mental health and awareness? Finding a balance between the main premise of the app as well as a relaxing, non-competitive gamified experience was the biggest challenge when crafting user flows and an overall sitemap. Spending time clarifying the overall app’s flow not only benefited my own process but also ensured a well thought out experience for the users as well.</p>

                <p class="pvisualdesign">To craft a logo and name, I began with sketches and word association exercises which helped me brainstorm concepts and the brand’s look and feel. With those in mind, I gravitated towards gardening and nurturing elements that contributed to both the brand and premise of the app. I settled on a minimal watering can element mixed with a sun as the handle as it connects well with the gamified experience as well as provides a feeling of caring and positivity. The name “Sproutful” steams from the suffix -ful, meaning “full of” and sprouts growing from seeds which ties in with self growth and the gamified experience of the app.</p>

                <li class="listspacelarge"><b>&mdash; Assist users in unique, app-specific icons and flows in multiple ways.</b> While user testing revealed that some users recognized the seed icon from onboarding, many users struggled with identifying the function of that icon in practical in-app use. Giving another visual guide, like a small pop over message, for first time users can be something quick and non distracting but helps aide users confidence and engagement with the app.</li>
                <li class="listspacelarge"><b>&mdash; Thinking critically and empathetically about choices presented to users is key.</b> Designing for the situations a user would encounter and providing them appropriate options and flexibility across all screens helps build a more expected, enjoyable experience. Do returning users go through all onboarding screens or are they more likely to simply log in on the first screen? What if a user wants to cancel their changes they made to their activity mid-flow? Providing the user with the most applicable options helps them navigate to get the most out of their app experience. </li>
