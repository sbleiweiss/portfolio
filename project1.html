            <p>With an ever increasing competitive cloud storage platform market, it is crucial to find the right set of innovative features in a new platform to succeed in the market.</p>
            <p>How can we provide a new way for creatives to source, save &amp; share new visual inspiration that meets their aesthetic needs, right from their fingertips?</p>
            <p class="solution">The solution</p>
            <p>Moodspire is a visual cloud platform that allows users to search for visual content by mood or desired asethetic. Users can save visual content in their own collections or browse otherâ€™s.</p>
            <p class="project1Pspace">Whether it be for a professional design project or finding inspiration for personal use, Moodspire is the perfect place to source new visual inspiration, save &amp; share it from others or even upload your own.</p>

                <li><b>100%</b> of respondants currently use at least 1 of the 10 listed visual cloud platforms</li>

            </ul>
            <p>My user research not only helped me understand the current habits of users and focus my research on what features and flows users were already familiar with and found useful as well as where opportunities lay to stand out from other platforms.</p>

            <p>With so many visual cloud platforms already available, I chose to focus in on three major competitors to enhance my understanding of the marketplace and review their strengths and areas of opportunity through a SWOT analysis.</p>
            <p>All three platforms had strong and engaging visual content that was categorized in at least one way. Areas of opportunity lay in optimizing screen real estate for the visual content and encouraging cross collaboration between users.</p>

            <p>Through analyzing my research so far, two themes of users emerged. Professionally, users want a platform where they can easily and quickly source beautiful visual content for creative projects. They need to be able to share and collaborate with other team members and be able to easily reorganize content. For others who pursue their creative projects on a more personal level, users want to easily browse categories of interest, source inspiration, and also have control over how those categories are sorted.</p>

            <p>Building off my research, I began the initial sketches for the wireframes for each of the user stories and flows I created earlier. I then used Figma to turn those sketches into a lo-fi prototype. I then tested my prototype with users. I asked users to complete 3 tasks: sign up for an account, add (upload) a piece of content and organize a piece of content to a new collection.</p>
            <p><b>Key takeaways and action items from user testing:</b></p>
            <p>&mdash; Fill out all text fields so that users have a more natural &amp; realistic testing experience</p>

            <p>&ldquo;It was good. With a keyboard it wouldnâ€™t have caught me up at all.&rdquo; &mdash; User 2</p>

            <p>&mdash; Ensure all icons and design elements have one dedicated function to ensure clarity for users</p>

            <h3 class="stages">Brand story &amp; logo</h3>
            <p>I began the branding process through mind mapping, sketch and word association exercises on paper. Keeping the target audience and mission of discovering new visual content by mood grounded my sketches and I explored a variety of concepts refining my sketches down to clouds associating with the cloud storage market and the mood given from cloudy, stormy, rainy day. From here, I chose to merge my idea of the brand name &ldquo;moodspire&rdquo; and the concept of a cloud and play with the way that it could be incorporated into the shape of a cloud. I aimed to keep my logo minimalistic and clean.</p>

            <h3 class="stages">Colors</h3>
            <p>Creating a dark interface for the visual cloud platform to place emphasis on the visual content was the root of the colors chosen for the palette. Each warmer, lighter color chosen in the palette was used for text, icons, or to highlight a part of the visual design.</p>

            <h2 class="process">Conclusion</h2>
            <h3 class="stages">How was the problem solved?</h3>
            <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                <li>&mdash; Focused in on providing a service to a specific target audience that was well researched</li>
                <li>&mdash; Built out and presented only necessary features outlined by the project brief and researched MVP</li>
                <li>&mdash; Ensured that visual hierarchy was clear and mobile screen real estate was effectively utilized</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="stages">Major takeaways</h3>
            <p>Some of my largest key takeaways from working on moodspire:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                <li><b>&mdash; Building off of existent familiar features and patterns can yield really accessible designs.</b> Through my user testing, some of the screens that were most successful and gave the users most confidence navigating through utilized very familiar icons and patterns.</li>
                <li><b>&mdash; Feedback through comments, user and preference testing is a process that should be heavily utilized through the entire design process.</b> I was able to refine my designs through asking for specific feedback from experienced designers as well as collect data from a diverse group of users about what flows and features were effective and intuitive.</li>
                <li><b>&mdash; Keeping the target audience in mind can help inform effective design decisions.</b> While there was an opportunity to style various aspects of the mobile screens I designed, many of my initial ideas that were heavily stylized were not finalized in my high fidelity mockups. My user personas indicated they wanted a way to source a lot of great images and clearly and quickly save and organize photos which helped me make design decisions that benefited my users the most.</li>
